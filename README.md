### ETL-Project-Group-9

# Team Members: 
Chad Dubiel, David Martinez, Katy Fuentes

# Scope of Research:
Correlation between cryptocurrency pricing and Covid case counts.

# Github Repo:
https://github.com/cdubiel08/ETL-Project-Group-9 

# Data Sources:
*   API Key - SFOX https://www.sfox.com/developers/?python#market-data or Gemini https://docs.gemini.com/websocket-api/#market-data 

# Source:
*	Covid - https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report 
*	Cryptocurrency Historical Chart - https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data 

# Other: 
*   What useful investigation could be done with the final database?
    Use the output and compare to markets, commodities, or US dollar.
*   Whether final database will be relational or non-relational. Why? 
    Relational because the information will be interconnected based on a timeframe.

# Considerations: 
Dates not a good join method, need a unique ID for primary key

# Data Analysis
*   Pandas - for data formatting, date cleaning, reduce columns 
*	Mongo - better for skipping null values which would skip data column, any covid/crypto overlaps captured

### Steps

# Data Sources:
*   At least 2 (or more) sources
*   If possible, try to incorporate a web API as one of your data sources.

# ETL Process:
*   Within Jupyter, build out the ETL process to extract your data from their sources, apply some level of transformation, and
    load the resulting data to a database (relational or non-relational)

# Flask API:
*   Build a Flask application that has a route that will execute a query to your database and return the results in JSON format.

# Final Report:
*   Write up a short report that details your 3 ETL steps.
*   More details on a later slide.

# Github Repo:
*   Store all of your project files in a well-organized project repository
*   Each member of your team will submit a link to your project repo to BCS by the end of class Tuesday

# Write Up Process Summary:
*   What data sources you chose and why? 
*   Detailing the process of the extraction, transformation, and loading steps 
*   Explain why you have performed the types of transformation you did 
*   Why you chose the type of final database 
*   Schema of the tables/collections in the final database 
*   Hypothetical use case(s) for your database
